		        			<p>Our vision is to create community through gardening for people. As horticultural therapists, we are trained to work with people with diverse challenges, and combined with best gardening practices we are able to create successful experiences for all gardeners.</p>
		        
									<p>Community Cultivators brings people together through organic gardening by facilitating relationships and creating opportunities for successful activity. We work with organizations such as assisted living and other residential sites to develop programming for existing gardens. Our staff can provide weekly garden sessions or monthly workshops. We can assist in the planning of garden events and activities, and we can train staff and caregivers to enable others to work safely in the garden.</p>

									<p>Community Cultivators can assist in the design of accessible gardens, whether in a backyard or on a porch, or in a residential community. Developing appropriate educational programming to support the gardens and gardeners ensures a successful experience. Whether teaching people how to grow their own organic food, or enabling a person to revel in the joy of growing and tending flowers, our passion is in creating access to gardening.</p>
